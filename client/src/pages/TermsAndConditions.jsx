                    Trading Cryptocurrencies on margin carries a high level of
                    risk and may not be suitable for everyone. Past performance
                    is not indicative of future results. Before getting involved
                    in Cryptocurrency trading, you should carefully consider
                    your personal venture objectives, level of experience, and
                    risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain
                    a loss of some or all of your initial deposit, and therefore
                    you should not place funds that you cannot afford to lose.
                    You should be aware of all the risks associated with
                    Cryptocurrency trading and seek advice from an independent
                    financial advisor. GGBP will not accept any liability for
                    the loss of some or all of your initial funds.

                    Benefits and Risks of Leverage Trading
                </h2>
                <p className="terms-paragraph">
                    Leverage allows traders the ability to enter into a position
                    worth many times the account value with a relatively small
                    amount of money. This leverage can work with you as well as
                    against you. Even though the Cryptocurrency market offers
                    traders the ability to use a high degree of leverage,
                    trading with high leverage may increase the losses suffered.
                    GGBP will not accept any liability for the loss of some or
                    all of your initial investment or any associated broker
